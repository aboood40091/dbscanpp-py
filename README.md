# dbscan-py
An implementation of DBSCAN in Python, using NumPy and SciPy, for educational purposes, providing competitive performance to the likes of scikit-learn.  
If this iterative implementation does not scale well to your data, you can find a distributed implementation of DBSCAN in PySpark [here](https://github.com/aboood40091/pyspark_dbscan/tree/master).
